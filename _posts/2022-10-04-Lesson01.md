## Submissions

### T1. What is Statistics

It is general consensus that Statistics is

> The discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. [^1]

> The science of collecting and analyzing statistics. [^oxforddict]

> The science concerned with developing and studying methods for collecting, analyzing, interpreting and presenting empirical data. [^2]

> A discipline which is concerned with: [^3]
+ Designing experiments and other data collection
+ Summarizing information to aid understanding
+ Drawing conclusions from data
+ Estimating the present or predicting the future. 

### T2. What is a Dataset

A Dataset is a collection of data which we visualize as a table or, in a more algebraic form, as a matrix. <br>
It is the result of the application of observation of certain attributes on certain objects. <br>
It is the object of interest of Statistical Analysis, representation and so on, in general of Statistical techniques. 

To produce a Dataset first we have to identify our objects of interest which we will call our *Statistical Population*,
each object of the population is called a *Statistical Unit*, second we have to decide a group of attributes or variables against which we want to observe our population.
With these two points done we can produce our Dataset easily by observing the Statistical units against the attributes.

In a more formal way:

*Statistical Population* <br>
$$ U = u_{1}, u_{2}, ..., u_{n} $$ where *n* is the number of units in the population.

*Attributes* <br>
$$ X = x_{1}, x_{2}, ..., x_{k}$$ where *k* is the number of attributes.

*Dataset* as a table

| Pop. \ Attr.| $$ x_{1}$$ | $$ x_{2} $$| ... | $$x_{j}$$ | ... | $$x_{k}$$
| :---: | ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $$u_{1}$$ | $$x_{11}$$ | $$x_{12}$$ | ... | $$x_{1j}$$ | ... |$$x_{1k}$$
| $$u_{2}$$ | $$x_{21}$$ | $$x_{22}$$ | ... | $$x_{2j}$$ | ... |$$x_{2k}$$
| ⋮ | | | ⋮ | | ⋮ |
| $$u_{i}$$ | $$x_{i1}$$ | $$x_{i2}$$ | ... | $$x_{ij}$$ | ... |$$x_{ik}$$
| ⋮ | | | ⋮ | | ⋮ |
| $$u_{n}$$ | $$x_{n1}$$ | $$x_{n2}$$ | ... | $$x_{nj}$$ | ... |$$x_{nk}$$

*Dataset* as a matrix

$$ Χ = \begin{bmatrix}
x_{11} & x_{12} & ... & x_{1j} & ... & x_{1k} \\
x_{21} & x_{22} & ... & x_{2j} & ... & x_{2k} \\
⋮ & &⋮&&⋮ \\
x_{i1} & x_{i2} & ... & x_{ij} & ... & x_{ik} \\
⋮ & &⋮&&⋮ \\
x_{n1} & x_{n2} & ... & x_{nj} & ... & x_{nk}
\end{bmatrix}  $$

### T3. Find and list interesting applications of Statistics in Cybersecurity

Statistics in Cybersecurity is very important since by using the tools that it provides we can gather, observe and analyze data 
in a meaningful manner to understand vulnerabilities of our system, to identify malicious softwares from their structure, to observe patterns in attack target locations and/or frequencies and so on... 

**Hereby is a list of interesting applications of Statistics in Cybersecurity:**

#### Statistical Approach for Discovering Critical Malicious Patterns [^statappro]

> The analysed critical malicious
patterns can be an effective training dataset, towards classification
of known and unknown malware variants.

>By computing
the Distribution Frequency for each basic block residing in
all the malware families, the importance of being a possible
representative to become a critical malicious pattern for a specific
malware family is measured. This value is carefully computed by
considering the population of each malware family.

#### Cyber Risk Literacy and Education Index [^crle]

> Studies show that most cybersecurity issues stem from human error, such as accidentally clicking on a malicious link and downloading malware. Increasing people’s awareness and motivation on cyber issues should be a key element of every geography’s defensive strategy.

### A1. Researches about applications

> Create a simple applications in C# and VB.NET to play with handlers and to understand sintax differences betweeen the two languages

#### C# App [(Repo)](https://github.com/SLYW0LF/Lesson01-A1-CSharp)

This app is a simple WinForm composed of a button and two text boxes. <br>
What the app does is very simple, on button press the WinForm background color is going to change to a random color meanwhile what gets written in the
text box is responsively rendered upper-cased in the bottom text box.

Here's a GIF representing the functionalities:

![CSharp App](/assets/img/Lesson01-A1-CSharp.gif)

Here's the code used:

```c#
﻿using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.ComponentModel;
using System.Data;
using System.Drawing;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.Windows.Forms;

namespace Lesson01_A1_CSharp
{
    public partial class Lesson01_A1 : Form
    {
        private Random rand = new Random();

        public Lesson01_A1()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }

        private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
           
        }

        private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            Color randColor = Color.FromArgb(rand.Next(256), rand.Next(256), rand.Next(256));
            BackColor = randColor;
        }

        private void textBox1_TextChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(textBox1.Text))
            {
                richTextBox1.Text = textBox1.Text.ToUpper();
            }
            else
            {
                richTextBox1.Text = "";
            }
        }

        private void richTextBox1_TextChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {

        }

        
    }
}
```

#### VB.NET App [(Repo)](https://github.com/SLYW0LF/Lesson01-A1-VB.NET)

This app is a simple WinForm composed of: 
+ a serie of radio buttons
+ two text boxes
+ a group of checkboxes
+ a progress bar
+ and a button. 

What the app does is very basic, the top part lets you decide which greeting you prefer, lets you insert your name and lets you decide the rendered text font modifiers. Once you've stated your preferences you might click the "Generate" button and after a progress bar load the greeting gets rendered.  

Here's a GIF representing the functionalities:

![VB.NET App](/assets/img/Lesson01-A1-VB.NET.gif)

Here's the code used:

```vb
Public Class Form1
    Private Sub ProgressBar1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles ProgressBar1.Click

    End Sub

    Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click

        Dim greeting As String
        Dim fontStyle As FontStyle = FontStyle.Regular

        ProgressBar1.Value = ProgressBar1.Minimum


        If RadioButton1.Checked Then
            greeting = RadioButton1.Text
        ElseIf RadioButton2.Checked Then
            greeting = RadioButton2.Text
        ElseIf RadioButton3.Checked Then
            greeting = RadioButton3.Text
        ElseIf RadioButton4.Checked Then
            greeting = RadioButton4.Text
        End If

        If CheckBox1.Checked Then
            fontStyle = fontStyle Or FontStyle.Bold
        End If

        If CheckBox2.Checked Then
            fontStyle = fontStyle Or FontStyle.Italic
        End If

        If CheckBox3.Checked Then
            fontStyle = fontStyle Or FontStyle.Underline
        End If

        For i = 0 To ProgressBar1.Maximum - 1
            ProgressBar1.Value = ProgressBar1.Value + 1
        Next

        RichTextBox1.Font = New Font(RichTextBox1.Text, 18, fontStyle)

        If String.IsNullOrEmpty(TextBox1.Text) Then
            RichTextBox1.Text = greeting + TextBox1.Text
        Else
            RichTextBox1.Text = greeting + ", " + TextBox1.Text
        End If


    End Sub
End Class
```

### TA1. Researches about theory relevant to applications

> Main differences between C# and VB.NET (handlers, case sensitivity, delimitators, brackets, arrays, generic classes, etc.) 

Language comparison: [^langcomp]

> Though C# and VB.NET are syntactically very different, that is where the differences mostly end. Microsoft developed both of these languages to be part of the same .NET Framework development platform. They are both developed, managed, and supported by the same language development team at Microsoft. They compile to the same intermediate language (IL), which runs against the same .NET Framework runtime libraries. Although there are some differences in the programming constructs, their differences are primarily syntactic and, assuming one avoids the Visual Basic "Compatibility" libraries provided by Microsoft to aid conversion from VB6, almost every command in VB has an equivalent command in C# and vice versa. Lastly, both languages reference the same Base Classes of the .NET Framework to extend their functionality. As a result, with few exceptions, a program written in either language can be run through a simple syntax converter to translate to the other. There are many open source and commercially available products for this task. The only fundamental differences between the languages can be found in the implementation of interfaces and in the declaration, raising and handling of events. Although both languages are high-level programming languages, VB.NET maintains a slightly higher level of abstraction in some respects. 

| C# | VB.NET |
| ---| ------ |
| Uses C-style syntax | Uses English-like syntax |
| Is case-sensitive | Is not case-sensitive |
| Uses brackets to delimit blocks | Uses End statements to delimit blocks
| Uses semicolon to end instructions | Uses new-line to end instructions
